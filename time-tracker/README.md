# Time Tracker

This Rails application is a minimal Toggl clone for tracking how long you spend on different tasks.

## Getting started

1. Ensure Ruby 3.1.2 is available and run `bundle install`.
2. Execute `bin/rails db:migrate` to set up the database.
3. Start the server with `bin/rails server` and open `http://localhost:3000`.

You can create tasks and start or stop timers directly from the tasks index page.
